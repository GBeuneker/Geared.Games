<h1>Geert Beuneker: Programmer & Designer</h1>

<p>For as long as I can remember I have loved videogames. One day I discovered that I could not only play games, but also create them. This simple thought sparked a deep passion in me and suddenly I knew exactly what I wanted to become: a game developer.</p>	
<p>I major in Computer Science with a minor in Game Design at Utrecht University. I have experience in game programming, though my main interest lies in the design of games. There aren't many things I enjoy more than creating videogames.</p>
<p>Besides programming games I've also got experience in video production and video editing. I have produced several video game trailers, comedic videos and game analyses using Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere.</p>
<p>I aspire to become a self-sustaining game developer. I want to craft interesting and engaging experiences, both in the form of videos and video games. </p>
