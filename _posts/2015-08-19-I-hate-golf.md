A game where you weapon can't harm anything directly. Your bullets can only make something jump/dash or teleport.

## Description
Annoy your golfing rival with your amazing wind powers. He’s a really good golfer and will score a hole-in-one if you stand by and watch. Use your wind powers wisely to ruin his golf game!

## Motivation
This was a Ludum Dare game jam submission with the theme “Unconventional weapon”. The game was created in 48 hours and was the very first game jam I participated in.
