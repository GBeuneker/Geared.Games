A program that uses ray/path tracing to produce realistic visual images.

## Description
Based on a school project I built a path tracer. It uses several acceleration structures such as BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy), NEE (Next Event Estimation), Importance Sampling and Reussian Roulette. This is a project I like to keep working on, adding in new features or optimizations.
