A game where you don't control the character, but you control the level. You have to make sure the character reaches the end of the level by placing the right platforms in the right places.

## Description
In this game you donâ€™t control the character, you can only control the level. The character does all the walking/jumping while you have to make sure he makes it to the end by building the level.

## Motivation
This was the first game I created as part of my Game a Week challenge. As such the game was created in a single week. I wanted to experiment with some interesting new mechanics and quickly build a prototype using those mechanics. The idea was floating in my head for a while so this was a great way to quickly realize it and see if it was any fun.
