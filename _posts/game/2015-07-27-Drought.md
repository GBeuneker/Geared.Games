An attempt at telling a story through the environment. Walk through a dry desert land and explore the area.
<!--content-->

## Description
Explore the mysterious desert lands. You walk around and explore the structures left behind.

## Motivation
This game was my second experiment in my Game a Week challenge. It was also my first 3D project created in Unity so I wanted to make something simple. I decided to try and tell a bit of a narrative using the environment. I tried to show a divide between the poor people in the valley and the rich living on top of the mountain.
