    title: I hate golf
---

You must sabotage a golfing game using your magical wind powers. Make sure none of the golfers score a hole-in-one.
<!--content-->

## Description
Annoy your golfing rival with your amazing wind powers. He’s a really good golfer and will score a hole-in-one if you stand by and watch. Use your wind powers wisely to ruin his golf game!

## Motivation
This was a Ludum Dare game jam submission with the theme “Unconventional weapon”. The game was created in 48 hours and was the very first game jam I participated in.
