A game where you work together with a 3D and 2D character to solve puzzles.
<!--content-->

## Description
A innovative game where the 3D and 2D dimensions meet. Turn the 2D world around with your 3D character and reach places you couldn't reach before. Let your 2D character help you character in 3D as well by providing power to objects in the 3D world.

## Motivation
This was a project I had been working on for a while. I thought it was an interesting idea that didn't exist before and could become a cool game. I built a small demo/prototype to demonstrate the different mechanics and show a bit of the story I had in mind for it.
