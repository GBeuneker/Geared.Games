## Description
The game is a classic rendition of No Man’s Sky using oldschool Atari 2600 graphics and control schemes. Much like the real game, you can explore planets and… well that’s it basically. Have fun!

## Credits
Programming/Design: Geert Beuneker.  
Artwork: Anne van der Veen.  
Music: Podington Bear. (http://www.podingtonbear.com/)

## Motivation
I made this game for the gamejam Ludum Dare 36 with the theme “Ancient Technology”. The idea is that the Atari 2600 can be considered ancient gaming technology and we thought it would be fun to recreate a popular modern video game with the classic Atari 2600 graphics.
