## Description
You need to work together to complete all the puzzles. Jump on each otherâ€™s heads, grab the right powerups and figure out all the puzzles together.

## Motivation
This game was created for a game design course. We had to build a quick prototype and let others playtest the game. We then collected all the data and clearly documented all the feedback.
