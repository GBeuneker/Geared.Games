## Description
You are a cube attacked by a barrage of evil enemy cubes. Fight off waves of enemies using your magic powers. Upgrade the powers you can use, level up your character and try to get as far as possible.

## Motivation
I really wanted to speed up my workflow for creating games. Using XNA was alright, but it was quite a lot of work to create games with it. I had heard a lot of positive things about the Unity Engine, so I really wanted to try it out for myself. I decided to teach myself to use Unity to be able to create games faster. This was the project that came out of that process.
