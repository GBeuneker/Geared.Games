## Description
You control a stray dog looking for food and shelter. Look in dustbins, inspect trash on the street or try to gain affection from the humans passing by.

## Motivation
Astray was made for the narrative game design course during my Game Design Minor. I really tried t unite the narrative and the gameplay because I believe that telling a story through gameplay is one of the greatest strengths of video games. I wanted the players to experience what it was like to be a stray dog.
